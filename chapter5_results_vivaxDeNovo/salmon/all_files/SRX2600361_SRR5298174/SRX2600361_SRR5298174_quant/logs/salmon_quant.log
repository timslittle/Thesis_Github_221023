[2022-07-04 20:07:52.972] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16,707,498 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-07-04 20:07:52.979] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00425376% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
