[2022-07-05 15:35:02.527] [jointLog] [info] Counted 723,996 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-07-05 15:35:02.532] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0977527% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
