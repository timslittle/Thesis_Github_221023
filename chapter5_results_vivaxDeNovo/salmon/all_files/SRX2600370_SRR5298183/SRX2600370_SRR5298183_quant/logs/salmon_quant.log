[2022-07-04 20:08:48.749] [jointLog] [info] Counted 26,139,051 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-07-04 20:08:48.756] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00974153% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
