[2022-07-04 20:06:54.576] [jointLog] [info] Counted 24,145,843 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-07-04 20:06:54.581] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00317165% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
