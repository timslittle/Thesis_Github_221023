[2022-07-01 18:20:02.889] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3,510,880 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-07-01 18:20:02.893] [jointLog] [warning] 5.35472e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
